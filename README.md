ImmunoTrak:: Vaccination Statistics Tracking

ImmunoTrak will help achieve the child mortality reduction goal by increasing accessibility to vaccination routines and follow up procedures which are an essential part of the full immunization programme. This way, the children will get fully vaccinated in a process that will also actively engage their parents or guardians as a part of a vaccination awareness and education programme conducted by the involved governments and organizations.
While keeping this in mind, I intend to build a platform to be used by the immunization health workers to achieve the following:
    -Keep track of locations/regions where immunizations have not been done, are ongoing or have been completed     for better convenience. 
    -Capture the information of the children during the immunization process to avoid omissions.
    -Capture the parents’ information to easily keep track of the children whose information has been submitted.
    -Store a database of the children’s photos for easier identification in case reference is needed.
    -Allow for the health workers to contact the parents on matters related to their children’s future               immunization needs i.e. dates and the types of immunizations needed.
    -Allow real-time analysis of the vaccination data and display it on a relevant platform.
